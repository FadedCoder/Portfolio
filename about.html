            <p>
                I was born and raised in Rajasthan, India. Born on 8 December of 2001, I am currently 19. My hobbies include gaming, music, coding, philately, anime and meeting new people.
                I have done my 12 years of schooling from St. Xavier’s school and have started my undergrad studies in IIT Kharagpur in 2020 under the Exploration Geophysics branch.
                I have no particular plans for future regarding the career I would pursue, everything is just so interesting that I do not wish to commit myself to one path and feel like I missed out on a lot in doing so,
                but I am quite partial to different software and development related fields as computers have been a major part of my life and I have picked up multiple languages due to this. C, C#, Python, JavaScript and Java to be specific and I plan to learn more as time goes on.
                I like working on my language and writing skills in my free time as well and hope to learn more languages outside of the ones I already know.
            </p>

                I am currently a part of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cgliitkgp" target="_blank">CGL</a>, IIT Kharagpur and am working on making my first Android game. The aim was a fairly basic game with quite a simple and straightforward build, hopefully it doesn’t come off as too basic and lame. Here’s to hoping.
                The game is titled <strong>Deadly Blitz</strong> and will hopefully be on Google Playstore soon. While I do not expect it to reach a vast majority of the audience, I do hope that the few who do play it find it enjoyable.
